----

Here you find examples how to use the BLE communication. 

The examples are as follows:

- Using BLE to sense the  proximity between devices [BLE Proximity Sensing](ble_proximity_sensing/)
- BLE services for firmware Upgrade **O**_ver_**T**_he_**A**_ir_ ([BLE OTA DFU](ble_ota_dfu/))
- BLE services for [BLE UART](ble_uart/)

----
## BLE Proximity Sensing
This example shows how to scan BLE for nearby devices and how to advertise the device so it can be found by other BLE devices.

----
## BLE OTA DFU
This example shows how to prepare the RAK4631 for OTA DFU => Over The Air Firmware Upgrade.

----

## BLE UART

This examples initializes a BLE UART service. You can communicate between two BLE devices the same way you would do over a Serial connection.
